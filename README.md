A collection of assignments completed for the  
**Data Structures and Algorithms** module.

This repository showcases implementations of various data structures and algorithms in **Java**, including custom array lists, linked lists, stacks, queues, recursion, sorting, and time complexity analysis. Assignments focus on OOP integration with DSA concepts.

## 🚀 Getting Started
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Lehlohonolo-Saohatse/data-structures-algorithms-projects.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the project folder**:
   ```bash
   cd data-structures-algorithms-projects
   ```
3. **Install dependencies** (if any):
   - Ensure **Java 17** or compatible JDK is installed.
   - Compile and run Java files in each assignment folder:
     ```bash
     javac *.java
     java MainClass
     ```

4. **Explore the assignments**:
   - Each assignment folder contains Java code (.java), README with objectives, instructions, and outputs.
   - Refer to individual assignment READMEs for detailed setup and execution.

## 🧪 Assignments Overview
- **[Assignment 1: OOP Inheritance and Polymorphism](assignments/assignment1_oop_inheritance/)**  
  Create a super class with two sub classes, demonstrating inheritance, polymorphism, and toString methods.

- **[Assignment 2: Sorting and Time Complexity](assignments/assignment2_sorting_complexity/)**  
  Extend Assignment 1 with array storage, sorting, and time complexity analysis (detailed, simplified, Big O).

- **[Assignment 3: Hangman Game with MyArrayList](assignments/assignment3_hangman_arraylist/)**  
  Implement Hangman using custom MyArrayList for word storage, sorting, and game logic.

- **[Assignment 4: MyLinkedList Extensions](assignments/assignment4_linkedlist_extensions/)**  
  Add methods like getMax, getMin, equals, getUnique, isPalindrome, getFiltered to MyLinkedList.

- **[Assignment 5: Contacts with Stack and Queue](assignments/assignment5_contacts_stack_queue/)**  
  Extend StackAsMyLinkedList and QueueAsMyLinkedList for a contacts management system.

- **[Assignment 6: Recursion with MyLinkedList](assignments/assignment6_recursion_linkedlist/)**  
  Implement recursive multiplication by 5 on linked list elements for contacts or numbers.

- **[Assignment 7: Recursive Queue Sort](assignments/assignment7_recursive_queue_sort/)**  
  Recursively sort a queue implemented as linked list in ascending order.

- **[Assignment 8: Bucket Sort Implementation](assignments/assignment8_bucket_sort/)**  
  Explain and implement Bucket Sort step-by-step for educational purposes.

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- **Java 17**: For all implementations.
- **IDE**: Any Java IDE like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse (optional).
- **Git**: For version control.
